Abstract

The aim of the project is to implement an Online Ordering System (OOS) suitable for an online shop, providing flexibility to adapt to new and changing requirements. This Online Ordering System (OOS) is an automated version of the manual Online Ordering System (OOS) and using this software means securing the activities of the shopping system. The vision is to provide a progressive and expandable information service to viewers, customers and admin.

E-commerce refers to the purchase and sale of goods and/or services via internet. Online Ordering System is a part of e-commerce. ONLINE ORDERING SYSTEM (OOS) is a website designed primarily for use in the foods/medicines/clothes delivery. Through these services restaurants/ shopping malls/pharmacies can sell and distribute their resources at minimal resource usage effectively with high profits by gaining the customer trust. This Online Ordering System database will be helpful for the business owners to extend their business just by placing the orders online and not visiting the restaurants, shopping malls and pharmacies.

There is no confinement for placing and receiving the orders, since the order can be placed online. There will be no waiting time with the vast amount of verities at the comfortable prices. To develop this application database is the main part which will communicate through the application to retrieve the details.

In future, we will be creating the online ordering database with Oracle as a platform.

Database includes customers can place their orders from different categories like clothes, foods and medicines and staff will process the orders and deliver the requested order with an expected delivery time.

With this application, users or any organization can perform actions like,
1.	Visitors will only be able to see product details but will not be able to order.
2.	Customer registration (Login, Sign up)
3.	Add to Cart by customers 
4.	Admin Log In
5.	Product setup (Create, Edit, Active/Inactive)
6.	Stock setup (Create, Edit, Active/Inactive)
7.	Order setup (Edit, Receive/Pending/Rejected)
8.	Invoicing system(Confirm/Cancle)
9.	Message setup (send and view)
10.	Product types setup (Create, Edit, Active/Inactive)
11.	Brands setup (Create, Edit, Active/Inactive)
12.	Roles (Create, Edit, Active/Inactive)

Chapter 1
Introduction 

















1.1	   Introduction 
Life of 21st century has become dependent on Technology. People become frequent with the usages of internet and software. They are searching for new facilities. Day to day this demand of new facilities are increasing tremendously. The World Wide Web (WWW) is contributing greatly for the creation of huge information database. Web based software are creating a new dimension in this modern world of technology. 
The goal of this project is to create a system to maintain the details of products of our shop. It makes easier to maintain the product details than the manual system.                                         We named it RJ FASHION ONLINE SHOPPING.                                                                                        
As it is an online platform we categorized our users in three section.
1.1.1	Visitor
Who visited our site for various need and at the same time gather current product information and if they want to add more details they share their view.
1.1.2	Customer or User 
User who always use our service. We include a system so that our user can register to our platform and we mention them as registered member or our customer. 
1.1.3	Admin 
Admin represents the key role in our platform. He have the authority to control the whole system and perform the necessary tasks. For Example: Product management, Order, Maintaining categories list etc. 
1.1.4	Goal
Shopping has long been considered a recreational activity by many. Shopping online is no exception. The goal of this application is to develop a web based interface for online retailers. The system would be easy to use and hence make the shopping experience pleasant for the users. The goal of this application is


1.	To develop an easy to use web based interface where users can search for products, view a complete description of the products and order the products.
2.	A search engine that provides an easy and convenient way to search for products specific to their needs. The search engine would list a set of products based on the search term and the user can further filter the list based on various parameters.
3.	A Vue.js enabled website with the latest Vue.js controls giving attractive and interactive look to the web pages and prevents the annoying post backs.
4.	A user can view the complete specification of the product along with various images.

1.1.5	Background of Project 
Now we will explain how our platform support the user and how it works. 
As it represent online shopping system so product buyer and seller are the main character playing key role here. If one have to take our service as a user or customer he must have to register in our site with the necessary information and for that we will use a login form for our user. It provide us the opportunity to know about user and at the same time it add safety in our platform. 
As a registered customer one will find his profile in our platform or site and he will have the options or facilities to place order, buy product and to checkout system that we have placed in our platform. 
In today's world for safe and secure business we need our payment record so we will introduced an advanced system in our platform that provide payment invoice to user immediately after making checkout in our platform. 
We will also give our user the opportunity to share their message in our platform and in many conditions they have the right to logout from our platform. 
To run our platform an administration needed and an admin can play the role. We will introduce the system in our platform so that the admin manage the product categories (Food, Clothe, and Medicine etc.) included in our platform. Moreover manages to stock a variety of brands, product types and products.
Admin will also have the ability to manage orders and he confirms the sells. In certain conditions admin can change the Login System information to provide safety to our platform it indicates the admin panel logout or changing our platform login password. To make our platform more effective we are determined to give our best in making our project.

1.2	Objective 
The objective of project on Online Ordering System (OOS) is to developing a WEB based automated system, which will cover all the information related to the all products which is used in our daily life. For example – Food, Clothes, Medicine Items and many more. So by this WEB based automated system a user want to purchase something then it only a mouse click away to purchase these products. The main objective of the project is to learn and implement a real-time application on database for Online Ordering System (OOS). This Database will be a great solution for many start-up online ordering business, they can just start initially with less funds by posting their menu online with this application.

Feasibility Study

















2.1   Introduction of Feasibility Study  
Feasibility study is the beginning investigation for any software development. Simply a feasibility study is a short focused study that will check whether the system can contribute to overall objectives. It also justify whether the system can be developed using current technology and schedule. Feasibility study also checks the integration of the system with other system that is already in place. It assesses the technical, economic, schedule and operational merits of a project. From the perspective of Systems analyst Feasibility analysis is a primary tool for recommending whether proceed to the next phase or discontinue the project. In this chapter we will able to know the Feasibility of the proposed system. 
We will consider 4 types of feasibility study, they are: 
1.	Technical Feasibility 
2.	Operational Feasibility 
3.	Economic Feasibility 
4.	Schedule Feasibility 
2.1.1   Technical Feasibility 
Technical Feasibility focused on present technical resources of the organization and their applicability to the expected needs of the proposed system. Technical Feasibility is an evaluation of the software and hardware and justifies how it meets the need of the proposed system. If the technical capacity of the proposed system is sufficient to support the project requirements then the system will considered technically feasible. 
Technical Feasibility aims to answer the following questions: 
1.	Does the system fulfill the requirement of hardware and software? 
2.	Are the current Technical resources sufficient for the new system? 
3.	Is the project feasible within the limit of current technology? 
4.	Does the technology exist? 
5.	Is there enough man power like coder, tester and debugger? 
6.	Is the system fulfilling practical criteria?  
7.	Is it available within the resource constrains? 
8.	Can the system be upgraded? 
The answer of the above questions for the proposed system is yes. It fulfills all the criteria of Technical Feasibility. So the proposed project is technically feasible. 
2.1.2   Operational Feasibility 
Operational Feasibility measures how well a proposed system solves the problems, and takes advantage of the opportunities identified during scope definition and how it satisfies the requirements identified in the requirements analysis phase of system development. It also Justify how well the project will support the customer. 
Operational Feasibility aims to answer the following questions: 
1.	Is the project feasible to operate? 
2.	Will the system affect the users in considerable way? 
3.	Does the current mode of the operation provide adequate throughput and response time?
4.	Does the current mode operation offers effective protection against accuracy and security of system data? 
The answer of the above questions for the proposed system is yes. It fulfills all the criteria of Operational Feasibility so the proposed project is operationally feasible. 
2.1.3   Economical Feasibility 
Economic Feasibility assesses the viability, cost and benefits of projects before financial resources are allocated. Economic Feasibility also ensures the economic benefits of the organization. Economic Feasibility involves benefits and evaluation of effectiveness of the proposed system. 
Economic Feasibility aims to answer the following questions: 
1.	Is the system can be developed within the estimated cost?
2.	Is the system cost effective? 
3.	Will the proposed system give economic benefits to the organization? 
The answer of the above questions for the proposed system is yes. It fulfills all the criteria of Economic Feasibility. 


2.1.4   Schedule Feasibility 
Schedule Feasibility estimates how much time the system will take to complete. It justify that if the project can be completed within time or not. Schedule Feasibility is the most important term in Feasibility study. A project will not success if it fails Schedule Feasibility. 
Schedule Feasibility aims to answer the following question: 
1.	Can the project be completed within given time? 
The answer of the above questions for the proposed system is yes. It fulfills all the criteria of Schedule Feasibility. 
Finally from the above discussion it clear that the proposed system is feasible for proceeding into next phase as the proposed system fulfills all the criteria of technical, operational, economic and schedule feasibility.










Chapter 3
Software Requirements Specification (SRS) 
















3.1   Introduction
Software Requirement Specification (SRS) stands for Software Requirements Specification, which is a document that fully describes the expected behavior of a software system. Software Requirement Specification (SRS) is a process under the software requirement engineering process. This is the next phase after feasibility study in software requirement engineering process.

System Design and Analysis 

















4.1   Use Case Diagram
Use case diagram is the most known diagram type. A use case diagram is the simplest representation of a user's interaction with the system that shows the relationship between the user and the different use in which the user is involved. A use case diagram can identify the different types of users of a system. Use case diagrams give a graphic overview of the actors involved in a system, different functions needed by those actors and how these different functions interact. Use case diagram include use cases, actors, includes relationship, extended relationship and system boundary. A use case represents a function or an action within the system. Actor in a use case diagram is any entity that performs a role in one given system. The use case diagram of the system is given below.

4.2   Activity Diagram 
The activity diagram is basically a flow chart to represent the flow from one activity to another activity. The activity can be described as an operation of the system. It can be used to describe business workflow or the operational workflow of any component in a system. The activity diagram is given below    
4.2.1   Activity diagram of admin 
The administrator has all the rights to access the system. He is the one who has all rights to view the rules and product details, modify those details. He can add various product based on the category. He can also set the available quantity, brands of a product and its reasonable price. Also he can set discount in various occasion. Admin can also view the details of a messages. The admin have the power to generate the invoice so that users can also use the checkout to buy various product.

4.3   Entity Relationship Diagram 
Entity relationship diagrams are a way to represent the structure and layout of a database. It is used frequently to describe the database schema. ER diagrams are very useful as they provide a good conceptual view of any database, regardless of the underlying hardware and software. An ERD is a model that identifies the concepts or entities that exist in a system and the relationships between those entities. An ERD is often used as a way to visualize a relational database: each entity represents a database table, and the relationship lines represent the keys in one table that point to specific records in related tables.
ERDs may also be more abstract, not necessarily capturing every table needed within a database, but serving to diagram the major concepts and relationships. This ERD is of the latter type, intended to present an abstract, theoretical view of the major entities and relationships needed for management of electronic resources. It may assist the database design process for an e-resource management system, but does not identify every table that would be necessary for an electronic resource management database.
4.3.1   Objects
There are three main objects on an ER Diagram: 
1.	Entities 
2.	Attributes 
3.	Relation
4.3.2   Entities
An entity is a concept or object in the database. Entities are concepts within the data model. Each entity is represented by a box within the ERD. Entities are abstract concepts, each representing one or more instances of the concept in question. An entity might be considered a container that holds all of the instances of a particular thing in a system. Entities are equivalent to database tables in a relational database, with each row of the table representing an instance of that entity.



4.3.3   Attributes
The Supplier Name, Supplier Address, Telephone Number etc. A given attribute belonging to a given entity occurrence can only have one value. Therefore, if a supplier could have more than one address or telephone number then this should be determined before defining the attributes of that entity type. In this example the defined entity may require two or three address and/or telephone number attributes. It is the maximum practical instances of a given attribute that should be catered for in the entity type definition.
4.3.4   Relation
Relations are the connections between two or more entities. Relationship lines indicate that each instance of an entity may have a relationship with instances of the connected entity, and vice versa. Each entity type can always be described in terms of attributes, and these attributes will apply to all occurrences of that given entity type.
The Entity Relationship Diagram of the system is given below:
 

4.4   Database Design
Database is critical for all businesses. A good database does not allow any form of anomalies and stores only relevant information in an ordered manner. If a database has anomalies, it is affecting the efficiency and data integrity. For example, delete anomaly arise upon the deletion of a row which also forces other useful data to be lost. As such, the tables need to be normalized. This fulfils the last objective of ensuring data are accurate and retrieved correctly.
Database files are the key source of information into the system. It is the process of designing database files, which are the key source of information to the system. The files should be properly designed and planned for collection, accumulation, editing and retrieving the required information.
The organization of data in database aims to achieve three major objectives: -
1.	Data integration
2.	Data integrity
3.	Data independence
 
 
4.4.1   Fig: Database Design


4.4   Data Flow Diagram (DFD)
A data flow diagram is a structured analysis and design tool that can be used for flowcharting. A DFD is a network that describes the flow of data and processes that change or transform the data throughout a system. This network is constructed by using a set of symbols that don’t imply any physical implementation. It has the purpose of clarifying system requirements and identifying major transformations. So it is the starting point of the design phase that functionality decompose the requirements specifications down to the lowest level of detail. DFD can be considered to an abstraction of the logic of an information-oriented or a process-oriented system flow-chart. For these reasons DFD’s are often referred to as logical data flow diagrams.

System Testing

















5.1   Introduction 
Software Testing is a process which tests whether the software meets the requirements and fulfills all the criteria or not. The system can be divided into two main categories they are Integrated Testing and Release Testing. Software testing involves the execution of a software component or system component to evaluate one or more properties of interest. In general, these properties indicate the extent to which the component or system under test: 
1.	Meets the requirements responds correctly
2.	Perform functions successfully 
3.	Ensure usability
4.	Can be run in its intended environments 
5.	Achieves the goals of requirements 
The answer to the following question for this system is yes. All the functional works have checked and tested. After completing the testing process it has ensured that the software is running accurately and it has been fulfilled all the criteria of requirements. 
5.2   Scope 
The overall purpose of testing is to ensure the system meets all of its functional requirements. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the overall test plan and strategy for testing the system. 
5.3   Testing Goal
The goals in testing this system include validating the quality, usability, reliability, and performance of the application. Testing will be performed from a black-box approach. Tests will be designed around requirements and functionality. 
5.4   Confirmation Goal
Confirmation testing or re-testing: When a test fails because of the defect then that defect is reported and a new version of the software is expected that has had the defect fixed. In this case, we need to execute the test again to confirm whether the defect got actually fixed or not. This is known as confirmation testing and also known as re-testing. It is important to ensure that the test is executed in exactly the same way it was the first time using the same inputs, data, and environments. 
5.5   Test Rules
1.	Test every program statement and every path at least twice. 
2.	Test the most important and most heavily used parts of the programs most thoroughly.
3.	Calculate the expected output before the test is executed. 
4.	Test modules individually before they are combined then test integration modules. 
5.6   Important things about Testing 
1.	Test case needs to be simple and transparent. 
2.	Create a test case with End User in mind. 
3.	Avoid test case repetition. 
4.	Do not assume. 
5.	The test case must be identifiable. 
6.	Implement Testing Techniques. 
7.	Self-cleaning 
8.	Repeatable and self-standing. 
9.	Peer Review.
10.	Fixed all bugs after collecting all test result.









Chapter 6
Implementation & Maintenance 

















6.1   Introduction 
Implementation is next after testing. After a long explanation and building phases, the system is developed and tested. Implementation is the stage of the system development life cycle. The system is implemented into operation in a real environment. Formal acceptance typically terminates the implementation stage. After the implementation phase software development lifecycle is the most expensive and time-consuming. There are many ways of implementation. It must be decided which way to adopt prior to implementation. This phase required many things for consideration because a wrong approach could bring unexpected result. The risk associated with this phase should be sorted out. The typical advantages and disadvantages are also an important factor for implementation. 
For front desk implementation method will be parallel and the new system will run parallel to the old one. Implementation is expensive because too many people are associated with the process it’s also time-consuming as the works are completed during implementation. Backup should be used. If any problem occurs and the system would not affected badly. 
6.2   Education 
It is essential for any system that the users of the system must know the context of the organization need. The user must be influenced by the benefits of a new system to them. The first and foremost decision in education and training must be about the operator to be educated and trained. 
6.3   Training 
The training phase is a phase where the users of the system train. In training the following methods can be used: 
1.	Observation 
2.	Informal Discussion 
3.	Computer Assisted Training 
4.	User Manual 
6.4   Implementation Schedule 
In this section, provide a schedule of activities to be accomplished during implementation. Show the required task in chronological order, with the beginning and end dates of each task. 
6.5   Security 
If appropriate for the system to be implemented, includes an overview of the system security features and requirements during the implementation. 
6.5.1   System Security Features 
In this section, provide an overview and discussion of the security features that will be associated with the system when it is implemented. It should include the primary security features associated with the system hardware and software. 
6.5.2   Security during Implementation 
This section addresses security issues specifically related to the implementation effort. For example, if LAN server will be installed at a site with sensitive data preloaded on non-removable hard disk drives, address how security would be provided for the data on these devices during shipping, transport, and installation because theft of the devices could compromise the sensitive data. 
6.6   Implementation Support 
Hardware, software, facilities and materials are needed. This section describes the support software, materials, equipment, and facilities required for the implementation as well as personnel requirements and training necessary for the implementation. The information provided in this section is not site-specific. If there are additional support requirements not covered by the subsequent sections, others may be added as needed. This section describes personnel requirements and any known or proposed staffing requirements, if appropriate. Also describe the training, if any, to be provided for the implementation.
6.7   Maintenance 
Software maintenance must be performed to:
1.	Correct faults
2.	Improve design
3.	Interface with other systems
4.	Accommodation programs so that different hardware, software, system features, and telecommunication facilities can be used
5.	Migrate legacy software and Retire software 
Types of maintenance
In a software lifetime, the type of maintenance may vary based on its nature. It may be just a routine maintenance task as some bug discovered by some user or it may be a large event in itself based on maintenance size or nature. Following are some types of maintenance based on their characteristics:
1.	Corrective Maintenance: This includes modifications and updates done in order to correct or fix problems, which are either discovered by the user or concluded by the user error reports.
2.	Adaptive Maintenance: This includes modifications and updates applied to keep the software product up-to-date and tuned to the ever-changing world of technology and business environment.
3.	Perfective Maintenance: This includes modifications and updates done in order to keep the software usable over a long period of time. It includes new features, new user requirements for refining the software and improving its reliability and performance.
4.	Preventive Maintenance: This includes modifications and updates to prevent future problems of the software. It aims to attend to problems, which are not significant at this moment but may cause serious issues in the future.

Implementation Tools for the Project 












 
7.1   Tool’s 
1.	HTML
2.	CSS
3.	Bootstrap
4.	Laravel
5.	Vue.js 
6.	MySQL
7.	XAMPP
8.	Nexmo SMS Provider
9.	Vonage API
7.1.1   What is XAMPP?
XAMPP stands for Cross-Platform (X), Apache (A), MySQL (M), PHP (P) and Perl (P). It is a simple, lightweight Apache distribution that makes it extremely easy for developers to create a local web server for testing purposes. Everything you need to set up a web server – server application (Apache), database (MySQL), and scripting language (PHP) – is included in a simple extractable file. XAMPP is also cross-platform, which means it works equally well on Linux, Mac and Windows. Since most actual web server deployments use the same components as XAMPP, it makes transitioning from a local test server to a live server is extremely easy as well. Web development using XAMPP is especially beginner friendly.
7.1.2   What’s included in XAMPP?
XAMPP has four primary components. These are:
7.1.2.1   Apache: Apache is the actual web server application that processes and delivers web content to a computer. Apache is the most popular web server online, powering nearly 54% of all websites.
7.1.2.2   MySQL: Every web application, howsoever simple or complicated, requires a database for storing collected data. MySQL, which is open source, is the world’s most popular database management system. It powers everything from hobbyist websites to professional platforms like Word Press.

7.1.2.3   PHP: PHP stands for Hypertext Preprocessor. It is a server-side scripting language that powers some of the most popular websites in the world, including Word Press and Facebook. It is open source, relatively easy to learn, and works perfectly with MySQL, making it a popular choice for web developers.
7.1.2.4   Perl: Perl is a high-level, dynamic programming language used extensively in network programming, system admin, etc. Although less popular for web development purposes.
7.1.3   HTML
Every webpage you look at is written in a language called HTML. You can think of HTML as the skeleton that gives every webpage structure. In this course, we'll use HTML to add paragraphs, headings, images and links to a webpage.
In the editor to the right, there's a tab called test.html. This is the file we'll type our HTML into. Like any language, it has its own special syntax. A browser's job is to transform the code in test.html into a recognizable webpage! It knows how to lay out the page by following the HTML syntax.
7.1.4   CSS
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language.[1] Most often used to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.
CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document presentation, including aspects such as the layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple HTML pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .CSS file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.


7.1.5   LARAVEL
LARAVEL is a free open source PHP web frame work, created by Taylor Otwell and intended for the development of web applications following the model-view-controller architectural pattern and based on symphony. 
LARAVEL attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, and caching.
LARAVEL aims to make the development process a pleasing one for the developer without sacrificing application functionality LARAVEL is a scripting language that is often used to develop a variety of web pages and Internet applications. Files that have the .LARAVEL extension can contain text, HTML tags and scripts. These files are processed by a remote server and are then returned to the user's Web browser as plain
7.1.6   VUE JS
Vue.js actually a java Script framework with various optional tools for building user interfaces. Vue.js is one of the new software technologies that are being widely used across the world for web development. It is an open-source java Script framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.
Vue.js is a programming language that is run by most modern browsers. It supports object oriented programming and procedural programming. It can be used to control web pages on the client side of the browser, server-side programs, and even mobile applications. To write a Vue.js, you need a Web browser and either a text editor or an HTML editor. Once you have the software in place, you can begin writing JavaScript code. To add vue.js code to an HTML document, you need to create or open an HTML file with your text/HTML.
7.1.7   MySQL
1.	MySQL is a database system used on the web. 
2.	MySQL is a database system that runs on a server.
3.	MySQL is ideal for both small and large applications.
4.	MySQL is very fast, reliable, and easy to use.
5.	MySQL uses standard SQL.
6.	MySQL compiles on a number of platforms.
7.	MySQL is free to download and use.
8.	MySQL is developed, distributed, and supported by Oracle Corporation.
7.1.8   Vonage API
Vonage is a communication platform as a service (CPaaS) provider for consumers and businesses that makes it possible for customers to connect and communicate on any device through cloud-hosted voice, video, chat and short message service (SMS), Vonage allows developers to integrate real-time messaging, voice and authentication into applications without having to building backend infrastructure through its Nexmo API platform.

8.1.8.2   Verify API

The Verify API enables you to confirm that you can contact a user at a specific number, so that you can:

1.	Reach your users at any time, by ensuring that you have their correct phone number
2.	Protect against fraud an spam, by preventing one user from creating multiple accounts
3.	Add an extra layer of security to help confirm a user’s identity when they went to perform certain activities

7.1.8.3   How it Works?

Verification is a two-stage process that requires two API calls:

Verification Request 
 
1.	A user registers for your service via your app or web site and provides a phone number.
2.	To confirm that the user has access to the number that they have registered with, your application makes an API call to the Verification request endpoint.
3.	The Verify API generates a PIN code, with an associated request_id. 


4.	The Verify API then attempts to deliver this PIN to the user. The format (SMS or Text-to-speech (TTS)) and timing of these attempts are defined by your chosen workflow. If the user does not revisit your app or website to enter the PIN they have received, the verification request will ultimately time out. Otherwise, you need to verify the number that they entered by performing a Verification check.
5.	The user receives the PIN and enters it into your application.
6.	Your application makes an API call to the Verification check endpoint, passing in the request_id and the PIN that the user entered. 

--

Verification Check
 
7.	The Verify API checks that the PIN entered matches the one that was sent and returns the result to your application.

Conclusion 

10.1   Conclusion 
After having detail study on online shopping, we can see a great change in the behavior of people in many manners like their attitude, buying pattern. In earlier times people use to do manual shopping but now as time changed, people are becoming busy and due to which technology has brought a new revolution i.e. online shopping. As we started doing survey, it came to in notice that young age group people i.e. 15-30 uses of prefer online shopping because it is time and energy saving. But middle age group does not prefer much because they have wrong perception that by seeing the product one can get the goods of proper quality. And even some people does not prefer using plastic money i.e. credit cards.   
But online shopping has a great future but to be successful it is necessary to spread awareness about its benefit.
